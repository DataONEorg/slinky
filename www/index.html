    <h1>DataONE LOD Graph Service</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the D1 LOD service. You may want to look at the
      <a href="https://github.com/ec-geolink/d1lod">repository</a> which
      contains a README file explaining what this is. You may also want to look
      at the <a href="/d1lod.ttl">latest Turtle export</a> of the graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also open the <a href="http://lod.dataone.org:8080/openrdf-workbench/repositories/d1lod/summary">OpenRDF Workbench</a> to explore the graph.
